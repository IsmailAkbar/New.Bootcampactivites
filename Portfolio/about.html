<p class="p1">My passion in development has been around from a young age. I first developed a passion when playing a game from the app store,
    intrigued on how it was possible to create something so fun. My interest continued to grow when I created an ecommerce website for a friend and came to really enjoy HTML and CSS.
</p>
<br>
<p class="p2">
    However, with an insufficient background in programming I felt i did not have the skillset needed for this career.
    It seemed my education was pointing me towards another direction leading me to a career as a Laboratory technician. My career as a Lab tech began through an apprenticeship where i learned my role as well as being able to work in different departments such as QA, testing, Admin reporting and sample collection/booking in. Through my apprenticeship i obtained a qalification but also aquired many skills for example, being adaptive, teamwork, time management and problem solving.
</p>
<br>
<p class="p3">  
    Although I enjoyed my time as a Laboratory technician, I felt the need to really go for a career I would be passionate about. My journey thus began with self learning and enrolling on a bootcamp with JustIT developing my skills in software development to reach my new career goals.
