""" Rules of global Keyword
The basic rules for global keyword in Python are:

When we create a variable inside a function, it is local by default.
When we define a variable outside of a function, it is global by default. You don't have to use the global keyword.
We use the global keyword to read and write a global variable inside a function.
Use of the global keyword outside a function has no effect."""
